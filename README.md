# OpenAPI Preprocessor

Preprocesses our OpenAPI specs to prepare them for generation via Speakeasy (our API client library generator).

## Spec Directories

This repository manages several types of OpenAPI specifications in different directories:

| Directory                      | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `source_specs/`                | Original OpenAPI specification files provided as input to the transformation process. These are the source of truth for our API definitions.                                                                                                       |
| `generated_specs/`             | Transformed OpenAPI specs with server URL subpaths moved to individual API paths. These files are consumed by Speakeasy to generate client libraries.                                                                                              |
| `overlayed_specs/`             | Specs with various overlays applied (see Overlays section below). The overlays add additional metadata or modifications needed for specific purposes.                                                                                              |
| `merged_code_samples_specs/`   | Specs with code samples merged from multiple sources. These enhanced specs provide examples for documentation and developer usage.                                                                                                                 |
| `modified_code_samples_specs/` | Specs with code samples post processed (correcting issues with the generated code samples).                                                                                                                                                        |
| `final_specs/`                 | Final, fully proccessed OpenAPI specifications that combine code samples from multiple sources that have been post-processed for correctness. These files are consumed by the gh-pages site and ultimately make their way to developers.glean.com. |

## Overlays

The `overlays` directory contains OpenAPI Specification overlay files used to modify the base specs:

| File                                   | Description                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `info-name-overlay.yaml`               | Modifies the API title and adds Speakeasy naming metadata to improve SDK generation.                                                     |
| `strip-headers-overlay.yaml`           | Removes specific authentication headers from the API specification that shouldn't be exposed in the generated SDKs.                      |
| `speakeasy-modifications-overlay.yaml` | Contains extensive Speakeasy-specific modifications to improve SDK generation, including method name overrides and grouping information. |

These overlay files use the OpenAPI Specification Overlay format (RFC9535) to apply targeted modifications to the base specs without changing the original files. Speakeasy uses these overlays during the SDK generation process.

## Merged Code Samples Specs

The `merged_code_samples_specs` directory contains OpenAPI specifications with embedded code samples:

| File                                         | Description                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `glean-client-merged-code-samples-spec.yaml` | Client API specification enhanced with code samples in multiple programming languages. Used for documentation and SDK generation.   |
| `glean-index-merged-code-samples-spec.yaml`  | Indexing API specification enhanced with code samples in multiple programming languages. Used for documentation and SDK generation. |

These files are generated by Speakeasy after external repositories have run their workflows and uploaded code samples to the Speakeasy registry. They provide developers with working code examples for each API endpoint.

## Overlayed Specs

The `overlayed_specs` directory contains merged OpenAPI specifications that combine multiple API definitions:

| File                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `glean-merged-spec.yaml` | A comprehensive merged spec containing both the Client and Indexing APIs in a single document. This provides a unified view of all Glean APIs and includes Speakeasy-specific extensions (x-speakeasy-\*) for code generation. |

These merged specs are used for generating consistent client libraries across multiple APIs and provide a single source of documentation.

## Modified Code Samples Specs

This takes the specs from `merged_code_samples_specs` and runs `pnpm transform:merged_code_samples_specs` to correct issues with the generated code samples. This is done in the `.github/workflows/generate-code-samples.yml` GHA workflow.

## Final Specs

The `final_specs` directory contains the end product of all of the processing being done. These specs are copied into the published GitHub Pages site (in the `docs/specs/final` directory), and then used by [gleanwork/glean-developer-site](https://github.com/gleanwork/glean-developer-site).

## Workflows

This repository uses several GitHub Actions workflows to process the OpenAPI specifications:

| Workflow                        | Purpose                                                                                        | Trigger                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `transform.yml`                 | Transforms source specs and runs the `glean-api-specs` Speakeasy source to generate API specs. | Push to main (source_specs changes), schedule, manual |
| `trigger-client-generation.yml` | Triggers SDK generation workflows in all 4 API client repos.                                   | After transform.yml completes, manual                 |
| `auto-trigger-code-samples.yml` | Checks if all client releases are ready and triggers code sample generation.                   | Every 4 hours, repository_dispatch, manual            |
| `generate-code-samples.yml`     | Runs Speakeasy to generate merged code samples specs.                                          | Triggered by auto-trigger-code-samples, manual        |
| `deploy-pages.yml`              | Deploys specs to GitHub Pages.                                                                 | After generate-code-samples completes, manual         |

The processing follows this sequence:

1. Transform specs from source files
2. External repositories consume these specs and generate their code samples
3. We manually trigger code sample generation which pulls from Speakeasy registry
4. GitHub Pages deployment publishes all specs for browsing

## Transformation Process

The transformation script processes OpenAPI YAML specification files by:

1. Reading files from the `source_specs/` directory
2. Applying various transformations to prepare specs for Speakeasy SDK generation
3. Writing the transformed files to the `generated_specs/` directory

This script performs the following transformations:

- **Path normalization**: Moves server URL subpaths to individual API paths

  - **Before**: `servers.url = "https://{domain}-be.glean.com/rest/api/v1"`, `path = "/activity"`
  - **After**: `servers.url = "https://{domain}-be.glean.com/"`, `path = "/rest/api/v1/activity"`

- **Server variables**: Renames `{domain}` to `{instance}` in server URLs and variables

- **Security schemes**: Transforms `BearerAuth` to `APIToken` for consistency

- **Enum descriptions**: Converts `x-enumDescriptions` to `x-speakeasy-enum-descriptions` for Speakeasy compatibility

- **Component renaming**: Renames `Shortcut` to `IndexingShortcut` in indexing.yaml to avoid conflicts

## Output

Transformed files are saved to the `generated_specs/` directory:

- `generated_specs/client_rest.yaml`
- `generated_specs/indexing.yaml`
- `generated_specs/admin_rest.yaml`

## Usage

To run the transformation:

```bash
pnpm run transform
```
