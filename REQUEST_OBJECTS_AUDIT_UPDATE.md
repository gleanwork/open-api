# OpenAPI Request Objects Audit - Updated for Request-Only Focus

## Summary of Changes

The OpenAPI object type audit scripts have been updated to focus exclusively on **request objects** (used in `requestBody` and `parameters`), excluding response objects as requested. This change addresses the specific concern about Speakeasy client generation compatibility.

## Key Updates Made

### 1. **Scope Limitation**
- **Before**: Audited all `type: object` schemas throughout the entire OpenAPI specification
- **After**: Only audits `type: object` schemas that are used in request contexts:
  - `requestBody` content schemas
  - Parameter schemas (query, path, header, cookie parameters)
- **Excluded**: Response schemas, which don't affect client generation

### 2. **Updated Algorithm**
- Modified `collectOperationMappings()` to use new `mapSchemasInRequestOperation()` method
- Only tracks schema references found in `operation.requestBody` and `operation.parameters`
- Skips `operation.responses` entirely
- Added context tracking to show whether schema is used in "requestBody" or "parameters[N]"

### 3. **Enhanced Reporting**
- Report title updated to "OPENAPI REQUEST OBJECT TYPE AUDIT REPORT"
- Added subtitle "(Request Body & Parameters Only)" 
- All summary text clarified to mention "request objects"
- Clear notes explaining scope limitation
- Operations table shows context (requestBody, parameters[N], etc.)
- Recommendations section emphasizes request-only focus

### 4. **CSV Export Updates**
- Default filename changed to `openapi-request-object-audit.csv`
- Added "Request Contexts" column showing where each schema is used
- Object types labeled as "Open Request Object" and "Closed Request Object"
- Enhanced summary text to clarify request-only scope

## Results with Updated Script

Running the updated audit on `generated_specs/` shows:

### üìä **Current Findings (Request Objects Only)**
- **Files processed**: 3 (admin_rest.yaml, client_rest.yaml, indexing.yaml)
- **Request object schemas found**: 41
- **Request objects missing additionalProperties**: 41 (100%)
- **Request objects with additionalProperties**: 0

### üéØ **Priority Breakdown**
- **HIGH priority (open objects)**: 0 - No request objects without properties found
- **MEDIUM priority (closed objects)**: 41 - All request objects have defined properties and need `additionalProperties: false`

### üìã **Operations Affected**
- **41 operations** have request objects with missing `additionalProperties`
- All are MEDIUM priority (requiring `additionalProperties: false`)
- All issues are in `requestBody` schemas (no parameter schema issues found)

## Impact Assessment

### ‚úÖ **Positive Impact**
1. **Focused effort**: Only need to fix objects that actually affect client generation
2. **Reduced scope**: 41 request objects vs. potentially hundreds including responses
3. **Clear prioritization**: All current issues are MEDIUM priority (manageable)
4. **No breaking changes**: No HIGH priority open objects that could break clients

### üìù **Next Steps**
1. **Systematic fix**: Add `additionalProperties: false` to all 41 request schemas
2. **Validation**: Test with Speakeasy after changes
3. **Monitoring**: Re-run audit after fixes to confirm 100% compliance

## Usage

### Run Console Audit
```bash
node audit-object-types.js
```

### Generate CSV Report
```bash
node generate-csv-report.js [optional-filename.csv]
```

## Files Modified
- `audit-object-types.js` - Main audit script
- `generate-csv-report.js` - CSV export utility
- `REQUEST_OBJECTS_AUDIT_UPDATE.md` - This documentation

The updated tools provide the same comprehensive analysis but with laser focus on the objects that matter for Speakeasy client generation success.
